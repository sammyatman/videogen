# üé¨ GenAI Media Showdown

**A static, interactive page for comparing state-of-the-art video generation models.**

This single-page app visually contrasts the performance of cutting-edge generative video models across two major tasks:

- üñºÔ∏è **Image-to-Video (I2V)** ‚Äî video generated from a single reference image  
- ‚úçÔ∏è **Text-to-Video (T2V)** ‚Äî video generated from a prompt only  

Each model‚Äôs output is displayed side by side with scored evaluations, allowing for intuitive comparison across multiple qualities.

## üìä Evaluation Metrics

Each model output is scored (1‚Äì10) across the following dimensions:

- **Instruction Following**  
  How closely the video reflects the given prompt or reference.

- **Consistency**  
  Stability of visual elements across frames (e.g. character appearance, scene layout).

- **Realism**  
  Photorealistic fidelity in lighting, textures, and motion.

- **Animation Quality**  
  Smoothness and naturalness of dynamic motion and transitions.

- **Creativity**  
  Novelty and imagination in rendering, composition, or stylistic choices.
